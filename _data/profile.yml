    I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I conduct
    research in Distributed System Group,
    supervised by <a href="https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/xingda_wei" target="_blank">Prof. Xingwei Wei</a> and 
    <a href="https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen" target="_blank">Prof. Rong Chen</a>.
    Before joining IPADS, I received my bachelor degree of software engineering in Nanjing University, supervised by
    <a href="https://minxuepan.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Minxue Pan</a>. I joined BydeDance Seed training infrastructure
    team in 2024, mentored by <a href="https://wencongxiao.github.io" target="_blank">Wencong Xiao</a>.
    My research focuses on <strong>eliminating the performance uncertainty</strong> of machine learning systems in training and serving.
    For now, and through the first half of 2026, I remain fully devoted to my doctoral research.
